# Unpublishing pages

As a rule of thumb, we should never need to unpublish a page or set of pages. If a measure has been published that contains
inaccuracies or bad data, we will publish an update - but continue to make the 'wrong' version available for reference.
This is part of publishing statistics in an open and transparent manner.

Only in exceptional circumstances do we anticipate there might be a need to, temporarily or otherwise, make a page
unavailable (defacement, compliance, etc). In these emergencies, there is guidance for
[unpublishing a measure version](runbook.html#unpublishing-a-measure-version).
