## Template structure

Our site templates are all derived from a single base template, `base.html`, at the root of the templates directory.
The base template declares the interface for all sub-templates and exposes a number of blocks that can be overriden,
as needed, to customise content and structure. The exposed interface consists of the following blocks (closely
derived from the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template)):

* pageTitle
    * The name of the page as it appears next to the favicon (i.e. in the window/tab)
* headIcons
    * Override the default icons used for the page
* socialMetadata
    * Wraps around a set of blocks that define attributes for Open Graph and other social-sharing protocols
    * Helps links to our site render nicely and with useful metadata when shared socially via other sites
    * Sub-blocks:
        * socialType
            * Sets the type of page being shared (for us, our pages are generally of the `article` type)
        * socialTitle
            * The title of the page as it should appear when shared
        * socialDescription
            * A short description of the page to provide a summary or some context when shared
        * socialImage
            * An image to be displayed for the page when shared
        * twitterMetadata
            * Additional metadata that extends the Open Graph protocol specifically for Twitter
    * See also [http://ogp.me](http://ogp.me), [https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started)
* httpEquiv
    * Declares and defines any `http-equiv` meta attributes for the page, currently used for the inline Content Security Policy
* googleAnalytics
    * A hook into the inline JavaScript that configures our Google Analytics for each page
* headEnd
    * A hook into the end of the `<head>` element
* bodyClasses
    * Can be used to set the `class` attribute on the `<body>` element
* bodyStart
    * A hook into the start of the `<body>` element
* cookieMessage
    * Contains the global GOV.UK cookie messages
* header
    * Contains the default page header for the site, including the CMS header (if appropriate)
* phaseBanner
    * Wraps around the phase (beta) banner, used to override it on the homepage to invert the colours
* main
    * Wrapper around the declaration of the `<main>` element
    * Sub-blocks:
        * beforeContent
            * A hook within the main content container, but before and outside the `main` element
            * Sub-blocks:
                * breadcrumbs
                    * Renders the breadcrumbs for the page, using the `breadcrumbs` variable defined in each sub-template
                * flashMessages
                    * Renders flash messages for the page, retrieving them from `get_flashed_messages` exposed by Flask
                * errorSummary
                    * Renders an error summary for any forms on the page, populated from the `errors` variable
        * mainAttributes
            * A hook into additional attributes for the `main` element
        * content
            * Where sub-templates should declare the content for the specific page, including its `<h1>`
* footer
    * Wraps the default footer of the page, should it need to be overridden
* bodyEnd
    * A section just before the closing tag of the `<body>` element, most likely to include scripts for the page;
      by default this includes the main scripts for the site - such as `all.js` for the static site, and
      `cms.js`/`charts.js` for the CMS
