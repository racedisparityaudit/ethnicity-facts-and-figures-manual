# Redirects

We have an MVP system for implementing redirects on the static site. A database table, `redirect`, takes two values: `from_uri` and `to_uri`. These are **path prefixes**, rather than full URIs, and are applied to the S3 object keys. Redirects do not affect the publisher at all - they are only used to create redirect behaviour on the static site.

Example:
With a redirect is in place from `british-population` to `uk-population-by-ethnicity`, the following original browser request will be redirected to this updated URL:

* original:
  `https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/british-population/national-and-regional-populations/regional-ethnic-diversity/latest`
* redirected:
  `https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/regional-ethnic-diversity/latest`

The runbook contains guidance on how to [create a redirect](runbook.html#creating-a-redirect).
