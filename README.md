# Technical Documentation

This project uses the [Tech Docs Template][template], which is a [Middleman template][mmt] that you can use to build technical documentation using a GOV.UK style.

## Before you start

To build the Ethnicity facts and figures tech docs locally, you need:

- [Ruby][install-ruby]
- [Middleman][install-middleman]

## Making changes

To make changes to the documentation, edit files in the `source` folder of this repository. We use the [basic multiple structure][basic-multipage]. Each page is declared in the top level of the `source` folder with a single heading. All other content is then included, via [Ruby partials][partials], through markdown files in sub-directories.

## Preview your changes locally

To preview your new website locally, navigate to your project folder and run:

```sh
bundle exec middleman server
```

See the generated website on `http://localhost:4567` in your browser. Any content changes you make to your website will be updated in real time.

To shut down the Middleman instance running on your machine, use `ctrl+C`.

If you make changes to the `config/tech-docs.yml` configuration file, you need to restart Middleman to see the changes.

## Build

To build the HTML pages from content in your `source` folder, run:

```sh
bundle exec middleman build
```

Every time you run this command, the `build` folder gets generated from scratch. This means any changes to the `build` folder that are not part of the build command will get overwritten.

## Deployment
This manual gets automatically deployed to Heroku when changes are merged into the `master` branch.

## Troubleshooting

Run `bundle update` to make sure you're using the most recent Ruby gem versions.

Run `bundle exec middleman build --verbose` to get detailed error messages to help with finding the problem.
